      <p class="italic font-semibold">Donâ€™t you realize that in a race everyone runs, but only one person gets the prize? So run to win! All athletes are disciplined in their training. They do it to win a prize that will fade away, but we do it for an eternal prize. So I run with purpose in every step; so I fight, not as one who beats the air.

      <p>
        You never can tell the glory that God wants to get from that seemingly insignificant but difficult situation.  
      </p>

      <p>
        We live for His glory.
      </p>

      <p>
        So in fighting your fight of faith, fight to win!
